12002,"Ⅰ. Generate:
1. Place the machine workshop and building area will appear.
2. Connect the driver seat, engine, wheels and car body block in building area. 
3. Right click the machine workshop, click Generate to generate the machine.

Ⅱ. Notes:
1. #c0aaa1aArrow direction in building area#n is the front of the machine.
2. Units limit: 1 mechanical core(Driver Seat), 1 engine, 20 wheels and 39 passenger seats at most per machine. 1000 Car body blocks at most.
3. Generate place: In survival mode, blocks will turn #c0aaa1adirectly into machine#n. In creation mode, machine will be generated on the right side of the building area.
4. Car weight will influence driving experience: Wooden car is light and unstable. Iron car is heavy and drives slowly.
5. Car shape will influence the driving experience: Four wheel is more stable than the two wheel.
6. Car body blocks: Most #c0aaa1ablocks#n and #c0aaa1aminiature blocks#n can be used to build a machine. When the character #c0aaa1aenters building area#n, physical attributes can be seen at item tips.
  

Ⅲ. Load machinery
1. Hold #c0aaa1awrench#n in hand and use it against the machine. The machine will be turned into mechanical capsule. Please make sure there are #c0aaa1aspace in shortcut bar#n when you pick it up.
2. Place machanical capsule on the ground to re-generate the machine.
3. Mechanical capsule can be loaded in machine workshop and re-generate the machine as blocks.
 
Ⅳ. Interaction
1. Can collide other physical items. 
2. Can activate physics trigger block, wooden transducer, stone transducer and Shiny Star.
3. Can be grasped with gravity claw and plunger crossbow.

Ⅴ. About fighting
1. Unit destroy: Units have HP. HP will decrease after being attack. Unit will be destroyed when HP is 0.
2. Collision damage: Machine will be damaged when crach into things. The greater the crash, the higher the damage.

12638,"#cfa7a0fWhat is custom model?#n
Custom model is an appearance which blocks, props and creatures can use. Players can make bones, which are made from miniature model, with custom model editor. Then edit the animation on timer shaft. After you finish a model, you can generate it into a block, prop or creature. 
 
#cfa7a0fHow to enter the editing interface?#n
1. Place the custom model editor on the ground.
2. Select #c0aaa1asample model#n, or choose #c0aaa1acustom model#n to start from scratch.
3. Click the #c0aaa1aimport button#n on select mode type interface. Import the custom model, which is made before. Modify and save.
 
#cfa7a0fHow to edit a model?#n
1. Click the create button to create a new unit. Select the unit and create the sub-unit.
2. Drag the 3D coordinate axis or change the bone and model parameter. (Notice: The blue point is the center point. The rotation of the model is relative to the position of the center point)
 
#cfa7a0fHow to edit animation?#n
1. After you finish a model, click animation.
2. Click the first button below to edit the duration. 
3. Select the unit that you want to adjust. Click on the timer shaft to place the pointer at the point in time you want to change, click + to add a keyframe, or directly adjust the widget, and the keyframe will be automatically inserted.
4. After the keyframe is selected, you can adjust the position of it above the timer shaft or copy, paste, delete.
 
#cfa7a0fHow to generate a model?#n
1. Click the #c0aaa1abutton#n on the top left corner to generate block, prop or creature.
2. The generated custom model will be added in resource library.
3. Blocks in plugin library, prop and creature appearance can all use the custom model in resource library. 
 
#cfa7a0fHow to use sample model?#n
1. Select a sample model you like.
2. Select a loaded model on the right side.
3. Click the manage button. Select #c0aaa1aModify#n and choose a miniature model. Adjust the #c0aaa1amodel parameter#n.
4.Enter the animation editing interface. We've set some animations. You can adjust them as you like.

#cfa7a0fWhat's the difference between bone parameter and model parameter?#n
1. Use #c0aaa1abone parameter#n or #c0aaa1amodel parameter#n to adjust the units.
2. Bone parameter: Adjust the whole unit and the displacement, rotation, scaling of sub-unit. Sub-units are influenced as the main units change.
3. Model parameter: Will not affect the center point of the bone or parameter of sub-units.
4. You can only adjust bone parameter in animation editing.
 
#cfa7a0fWhat're the unit and sub-unit?#n
1. After selecting a unit, click to create a sub-unit of it. The newly created unit becomes the sub-unit of the selected unit. 
2. When you adjust the bone parameter of the main unit, the sub-unit will also change with it."

21562,大山的琴声
21563,"孩子们在烈日下排起了整齐的长队。他们看起来很腼腆，眼睛里闪着喜悦的光。来自各地的爱心礼物纷纷被急切的孩子们打开，很快操场上便此起彼伏地响起了稚嫩的口琴声，空气中伴随着风声传来了欣喜的气息。
  以志愿者的身份来到这片土地之前，我一直想象不到自己与这里的孩子们生活环境如此截然不同。这里的人们凭借着自己的双手努力生活着，孩子们红扑扑的脸上也写满了坚定。
  在一片琴声笑声中，有个光着脑袋的小男孩跑过来对我轻声说了句“谢谢”。他咧着嘴告诉我，他想好好念书，长大后去更远的地方，看看外面的世界。我看着他的双眼，身体的疲惫也烟消云散。像他这样的小孩有很多，我可能无法帮助到他们中的大多数人，但只要能让一个孩子露出笑容，一切努力都值得了。"
21564,彩色的自白
21565,我是一个“魔法师”。我能用自己的身体，涂抹出世界上最鲜艳美丽的色彩。我的出生，伴随着许多人爱心的凝聚。这些互不相识的人们，送来了许许多多像我一样的小伙伴。我们来到这里的使命，就是奉献出他们的一片热忱。  有一天，我和我的小伙伴们都被放进了一个精致的“小房子”里，经历了万里旅途，来到了遥远陌生的山区。在这里，我们被陈列在一群衣着朴素，眼睛里却有着星光的孩子们面前。很快，我有了新朋友，一位扎着马尾辫的、脸上红扑扑的小女孩。她牵着我的手，在白纸上描绘出了我见过最好看的画作。小女孩看着我，再看看自己的作品，开心地笑了起来。  在这个瞬间，我才意识到，她的笑容才是世界上最美的色彩。
21566,小小的异世界旅人
21567,"一年前，我家附近来了位陌生的朋友。它身材小小的，身体深深地扎进砂土里。我每天都会去原野里看他。它告诉我，它来自另一个世界，那里有很多跟它一样的兄弟姐妹们，与它一起旅行到了这里。
  很快，它的兄弟姐妹们也来了，小小的绿色脑袋站满了整片土地。我对它们的世界很好奇，每次过来都会问很多的问题。它们给我讲了好多奇妙生物的传说，我也跟它们讲了很多的故事，关于我、关于朋友、关于我生活的这片土地。它们会留在这里，一起让这里变得更加生机勃勃。
  看着它们一天天地长高，我心里特别高兴。它们说自己很快就能比我还高了。哼，我也在长高，才不会输给它们呢。"
21568,梦境中的华尔兹
21569,今天的梦，是一个开心的梦。在梦中，我跳起了最爱的舞，周围绽放了漫山遍野的粉红色樱花，散发着迷人的香味。我很喜欢这里，因为这儿有我的梦。  我喜欢跳舞，喜欢舞蹈时自由自在的感觉。可我却没有一双属于自己的舞鞋，直到我遇见了一群美丽的大哥哥大姐姐。  哥哥姐姐们来自很遥远的地方，他们给我们带来了希望。看着大家脸上洋溢的笑容，我仿佛也找寻到了希望。  “我想当舞蹈家！”，我坚定地看着哥哥姐姐们。  有一个大哥哥走过来摸了摸我的头。  “哥哥帮你实现这个愿望！”说完，他便递给了我一双红色的舞鞋。  我太开心了。双手捧过鞋子的时候，我感觉离梦境中的自己越来越近了。  我的希望，我的梦想，我的未来，我来了。
21570,星星的笑脸
21571,今天是一个美妙的夜晚，大山寂静地沉睡着，只有树林里传来轻轻的鸟叫声。我抬起头看着天空，看到了天上的点点繁星，它们仿佛在对着我微笑，这让我不禁想起来那群人。  听老师说，有一群从很遥远的地方来的大哥哥大姐姐，给我们带来我们需要的东西。我高兴极了。他们就像天上的星星一样，带着笑脸，给需要帮助的人们带来希望。  一颗星星的力量，是微不足道的，可是漫天的星星，却拥有巨大的能量。  我希望我长大了也能成为像他们一样的人，就像天上的星星一般，带着笑容的力量，一直闪耀下去。
21572,我最喜欢的东西
21573,"奶奶总说我把废纸浪费了
 留着还能擦鼻涕呢
 哼，其实我是要把他们变成我最喜欢的东西
 全都保护起来
 千纸鹤
 大飞机
 长钢琴
 小帆船
 还有两三颗星星
 但它们好久都没再新增成员了
 好像是奶奶把所有的废纸都藏起来了吧"
21574,迷梭梭与安吉洛斯 Ⅰ
21575,"清晰地记得她当时说“在来到阿拉善之前，我从未看过如此湛蓝的天空，也未看过晚上八九点还不下山的太阳，更从未见过一望无际的黄土与荒漠……”然后我好奇地问她外面的世界长什么样的？我听着她将外面世界的美好娓娓道来……
  后来我们一起在这片荒芜中挖坑，种上一株一株梭梭树，并在树林中立了一块标志牌。她一直非常担心，这些梭梭树苗在这么恶劣的环境中，它们能存活下来吗？荒漠能再现生机吗？哈哈哈，最后还是由我来安抚她焦灼不安的心情呢。在离开之前，她拿出相机，拍下这一片黄土和我们满带笑容充满希望的瞬间。
  哦对了，忘了告诉你，她是安吉洛斯，是一名爱心志愿者，嘻嘻。"
21576,迷梭梭与安吉洛斯 Ⅱ
21577,"前几天我翻看日记的时候，翻出那张与迷梭梭在阿拉善合影的照片，背景看上去满目荒凉，再次勾起了我对梭梭树苗的担心。我终于按捺不住内心的冲动，想亲眼去看一看那片土地上的梭梭树苗，它们还在吗？还是绿油油的样子吗？
  又是迷梭梭带我来到阿拉善。哇！眼前的一切我简直不敢相信，这一片曾经的荒漠，现在远远望去已经泛起了绿色，除了当时种下的梭梭树，竟然还有稀疏的野草。我直觉反应是来错了地方，直到看见不远处那块我们亲手安放的标志牌。算起来，距离我们上次来阿拉善才半年多而已，这里的主色调竟然从土黄变成了青黄相接。我无法形容内心的震撼，于是站在同样的位置，我们又拍了一张照片。"
21578,美好的祝福
21579,今天看到了一篇文章《多亏中印，地球比20年前更绿了》里面说“过去20年来地球新增绿化面积相当于整个亚马逊雨林覆盖的面积”，我又想起了我们在阿拉善种下的梭梭林，心中无比骄傲和自豪，阿拉善的梭梭树苗已经长高，它们改善了阿拉善的生态环境。  这一切都要感谢在迷你世界里参加公益的可爱孩子们，真心地祝愿你们永远健康、快乐成长！也感谢那些为了公益而贡献己力的人们，因为有了你们，这个世界才变得更加可爱、美好。

111530,"#cfa7a0f Introduction: #n
 -Dancing Hall MiniClub is a music game prop. After placing it in the developer mode and setting the area using the area tool, you can experience the music game and dance gameplay by converting the map to the gameplay mode. The gameplay supports multiple players at the same time.
#n
#cfa7a0fAbout settings: #n
 -Click on the dance hall props in the developer mode to call up the dance hall setting interface.
 -Region range selection: The size of the dance hall can be selected through the area function of the object library, and the scene construction can be built around the size of the venue.
 #cfa7a0f (Reminder: The dance in suit skins is not supported in the area, only custom-dressed skin characters are supported for dance. It is recommended that you build a dressing area at the entrance of the scene to provide players with custom dressings .) #n
 -Participant reward setting: You can distribute game items you set as rewards to game players through rankings and points.
#n
#cfa7a0fAbout how to play: #n
 -When the player enters the dance hall area, the game GUI will become the GUI of the dance hall. After the player uses the music player to select a song, the game will automatically start when the song is played.
 -When the music is sounding, it is not supported to join the game midway, and you need to wait for the next music to start again. "
